# AWS DDD API reference

Run `python -m http.server 8000` in this directory and open `http://localhost:8000`, or use the [published GitHub Pages site](https://leungyulap19.github.io/AWS_DDD_API_docs/). Open [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml) to save the contract for LLM tools and code generators. Choose an endpoint, fill its request fields on the left, and use **Send request** on the right. The preview follows those inputs and offers HTTP, Shell, Node, Ruby, and PHP examples. Success and error response structures are listed below the form. The specification uses OpenAPI 3.1 and YAML 1.2.

The 206 documented operations are the current routes with `PASS` verdicts in the migration live-test results. Five deferred routes and three excluded preview/smoke routes are omitted. A route verdict covers its isolated live cases; the separate system-flow verdicts have their own stated scopes. The YAML contract is checked against the current route, validation, and response source; a live-test PASS is not a blanket guarantee for every schema branch.

For frontend error handling, each operation lists the HTTP statuses its handlers return. Open a `4xx` response to see its JSON fields, the allowed `errorKey` values, and an example for each key. Branch on `errorKey`, not the localized `error` message. The `4XX` and `5XX` entries remain as fallbacks for gateway and unexpected responses. SF Express address payloads are passed through as provider-defined JSON because the Lambda does not validate their fields.

The published contract is [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml). Local generation and audit scripts are excluded from Git.

Enter the deployed API ID, region, and stage in **Credentials** before sending. Supply the API key, bearer token, checkout token, or device signature required by the operation. Credentials stay in the browser tab and are masked in copied examples. The page loads js-yaml from jsDelivr, so viewing the interactive reference requires access to that CDN.

Browser requests from GitHub Pages use the origin `https://leungyulap19.github.io`. The deployed API must allow that origin, its request methods, and the headers required by the selected operation. In AWS_DDD_API, set the deployment's `AllowedOrigins` parameter; the production workflow supplies it through `PROD_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
